* Assumptions made in the algorithm

  - Event will have start and end date in the same day
  - Multiple opening entries is possible in a day E.g [9 - 10:30], [12 - 3:30]
  - Appointment is created only on available slots
  - Each slot is of a 30 min duration


* TASK

  - The goal is to write an algorithm that checks the availabilities of an agenda depending of the events attached to it. The main method has a start date for input and is looking for the availabilities of the next 7 days.
  - They are two kinds of events:

    - 'opening', are the openings for a specific day and they can be reccuring week by week.
    - 'appointment', times when the doctor is already booked.
    - rails g model event starts_at:datetime ends_at:datetime kind:string weekly_recurring:boolean (sample event model)
